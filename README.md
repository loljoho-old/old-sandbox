# sandbox

A figurative container that would likely be rigid and rectangular if it were tangible, which contains mineral grains of a small size.

This repository serves as an environment in which untested or experimental code may reside in isolation from, and innocuous to, certain areas of sensitivity, e.g.:

   * Live servers, the applications they utilise, and the data they manipulate.
   * Code repositories, vetted distributions, etc.
   
Generally speaking, this encompasses nearly any collection of code, content, and/or data that, if damaged, carries a great weight of hindrance towards reverting the software back to a prior, functioning stage.
